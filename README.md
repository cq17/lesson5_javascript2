### Project Description:
The Tax Calculator application computes a user’s total income tax and determines the tax bracket
the user falls in. The tax bracket is the tax rate a user will pay on the highest dollar of taxable
income. The tax bracket determines the amount of the user’s income tax increases if the user
earns one additional dollar of income (ignoring the effects of rounding). In the U.S., we have a
progressive income tax system. This means that the more money you make, the higher a tax rate
you pay. Your tax bracket becomes progressively higher.
This application will find the IRS tax bracket for a user. The calculator will return an estimate of the
actual tax rate and tax amount for the user based on the users’ filing status and taxable income,
which are provided bythe user.
